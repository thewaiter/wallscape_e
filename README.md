# WallScape for Enlightenment

WallScape module is an alternative module for changing E/Moksha wallpapers.
It was surprisingly a part of Moksha core code called oddly "Wallpaper 2" and we 
wanted to separate it as a standalone extra module for Bodhi users. The module 
needs some time to use and check its functionality and potential bugs.
